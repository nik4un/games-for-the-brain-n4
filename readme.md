## List of games
#### Brain-even: «Parity checking»
The essence of the game is this: the player is shown a random number. And he needs to answer ``` yes ``` if the digit is even, or ``` no ``` if is odd.
Any incorrect entry is an error, for example, ``` n ``` equivalent to a wrong answer.
#### Brain-calc: «Calculator»
The essence of the game is this: the player displays a random mathematical expression, e.g. ``` 35 + 16 ``` that he needs to calculate and write the correct answer.
#### Brain-gcd: «The greatest common divisor (GCD)»
The essence of the game is this: the player receives two random numbers, e.g. ``` 25 50 ``` and must calculate and enter the greatest common divisor of these numbers.
#### Brain-balance: «Balance»
A balanced number is a number in which the smallest digit differs from the largest one not more than one. The order of digits in a balanced number is in ascending order.

For example, balanced number for the number ``` 29 ``` is the number ``` 56 ```.
